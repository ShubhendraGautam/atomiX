/* The syscall component seam.
 *
 * The kernel owns the trap: it decodes scause, saves the register file, and
 * decides which task runs next.  What it does NOT own is what an `ecall` from
 * U-mode *means* -- that is the ABI, and the ABI is selectable.  A component
 * implementing this header defines the syscall numbers, their signatures, and
 * their error convention; the reference implementation follows the RISC-V Linux
 * subset documented in docs/abi.md, and an out-of-tree component can define
 * something else without touching the kernel, the scheduler, or the loader.
 *
 * Trap-frame layout is fixed by trap.S and shared with the kernel. */
