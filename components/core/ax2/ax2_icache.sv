// ax2_icache: the instruction front end -- a direct-mapped instruction cache
// that owns the fetch PC and delivers up to two instructions per cycle.
//
// This module is what makes dual issue worth having.  The aXbus fetch port is
// 32 bits wide, so a core fetching straight off the bus can never sustain more
// than one instruction per cycle no matter how wide its back end is.  A cache
// line here is four words; a hit reads the whole line out of one block RAM and
// hands the pipeline the two words at the fetch PC, so a 2-wide back end can
// actually be fed.
//
// Storage is synchronous-read so the arrays map to FPGA block RAM rather than
// fabric flops (an asynchronous-read array cannot be packed into block RAM --
// the same constraint the main memory hit).  A lookup is therefore pipelined:
// the index goes to the arrays in one cycle and the tag comparison happens in
// the next, against the registered address.  That one cycle is the fetch stage.
//
// The module owns the fetch pointer rather than taking it from the core: the
// sequencing of accept / hold / refill / redirect is all interlocked with the
// array pipeline, and keeping it in one place is what stops those interactions
// from leaking into the core's hazard logic.
// Branch prediction lives here too, for the same reason: a predictor that is
// consulted anywhere but the fetch stage cannot steer the next fetch without
// costing a bubble, which is most of what it was meant to save.  The BTB is a
// direct-mapped bundle predictor -- one entry per fetch bundle, recording which
// slot held the branch, where it went, and a 2-bit hysteresis counter -- so a
// single combinational lookup covers both issue slots.
