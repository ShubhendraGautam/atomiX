/* The program-loader component seam.

 * program image and the contract a program starts under.  Those are separable:
 * a system that wanted flat images, or a compressed format, or a position-
 * independent one, would change only this component.
 *
 * The reference implementation is ELF32 (docs/abi.md), chosen because it is
 * what the toolchain already emits and it carries the per-segment permissions
 * the loader needs in order to map pages correctly. */
