/* The filesystem component seam.
 *
 * Two callers share it: the shell's `ls`/`cat`/`write`, and the syscall
 * component's `openat`/`read`/`lseek`/`fstat` by way of the kernel's file
 * hooks.  That is why reading is a byte range rather than "print the file to
 * the console" -- one lookup and one read path serve both, so the shell test
 * and the ABI test exercise the same code instead of two implementations that
 * can drift apart.
 *
 * A file is named by a small integer id, valid until the next mount.  Nothing
 * here is a file *descriptor*: descriptors carry an offset and a lifetime and
 * belong to the ABI, which is a different component. */
