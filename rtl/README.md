# rtl/ — synthesizable hardware

Synthesizable hardware lives in component folders, with this directory holding
the generic FPGA flow, architecture notes, and future role area. All authored
SystemVerilog stays within the Yosys-synthesizable subset: synchronous
single-clock design, BRAM-shaped memories, no latches. Everything must pass
both Verilator (simulation) and Yosys (synthesis) — that dual gate is what
keeps us FPGA-portable.

| Subdirectory | Role |
|---|---|
| [../components/core/](../components/core/) | Replaceable `aXcore` implementations |
| [../components/](../components/README.md) | SoC shell, fabric, memory, peripherals, and board implementations |
| [roles/](roles/) | Swappable accelerator roles (loopback, TPU-lite, …) |
| [soc/](soc/) | SoC architecture notes and integration entry point |
| [fpga/](fpga/) | Generic ECP5 synthesis, P&R, and programming flow |

The reference design is also available through the component catalog in
[`components/`](../components/README.md). A custom source can replace a CPU,
memory backend, stock peripheral, interconnect, cache policy, boot ROM,
simulation finisher, SoC shell, or board target at the build boundary without
requiring a rewrite of unrelated RTL. The intentional private boundaries are
listed in [docs/component-map.md](../docs/component-map.md).

Conventions:

- One module per file, filename = module name.
- No vendor primitives outside a `board` component; inference (BRAM, DSP) over instantiation.
- Every module gets at least a smoke testbench under `sim/` before integration.
