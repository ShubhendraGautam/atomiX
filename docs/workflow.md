# atomiX build, test & deploy — operational reference

**This is the single, canonical command reference for the project.** It covers
building, the full test surface, and real hardware deployment.  It is
maintained: whenever a milestone adds or changes a build, test, or deploy
command, this file is updated in the same change (see
[design-checklist.md](design-checklist.md) → change-ready checklist).

Architecture lives in [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md); component contracts in
[components/README.md](../components/README.md); host setup and tool quirks in
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md) and [toolchain.md](toolchain.md).  This doc
is *what to run*, not *why*.

All commands are run from the repository root unless a `-C <dir>` says otherwise.

## 0. Prerequisites (tiers)

Install only the tier you need; details in [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).

| Tier | Tools | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` (rv32 multilib), Verilator, Python 3, GNU make | build + simulation + component tests |
| Kernel | `qemu-system-riscv32` **≥ 7** | aXos S/U-mode boot checks |
| Formal | current Yosys, SymbiYosys, riscv-formal | `make -C formal check` |
| FPGA | OSS CAD Suite (Yosys, board flow tools, openFPGALoader) | synthesis + board deploy |

The board component selects the flow: ULX3S uses ECP5 (`nextpnr-ecp5`, `ecppack`),
Tang Nano 20K uses Gowin (`nextpnr-himbaechel`, `gowin_pack`).  Both ship in the
OSS CAD Suite; `make -C rtl/fpga check-tools` verifies the ones the selected
board needs.

Pass a non-default QEMU as `QEMU=/abs/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32`.  Load the
FPGA environment once per shell: `source "$HOME/opt/oss-cad-suite/environment"`.

## 1. The pipeline at a glance

```
 profile ─▶ build ─▶ test ───────────────▶ (synth ─▶ deploy)
 configs/   images    ISS · cosim · RTL       ECP5     ULX3S
            & ISS      roles · kernel · host   bitstream board
```

| Stage | Entry command | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| Profile | `make config-check-all` | every profile resolves to compatible components |
| Build | `make -C sim/axsim test` · `make -C sw/baremetal images` | golden ISS + a target image |
| Test | `make component-test` (+ the suites in §3) | selected components compose and run |
| Synth | `make fpga CONFIG=configs/ulx3s-85f.json` | the shell places and routes on ECP5 |
| Deploy | `make -C rtl/fpga program` | the bitstream runs on a real board (reversible) |

---

## 2. Build

### Choose / inspect a profile
```bash
make component-list                              # catalog of selectable components
make component-show COMPONENT=role.gpu-compute   # one manifest
make config-check   CONFIG=configs/sim-bram.json # resolve one profile
make config-check-all                            # resolve every profile in configs/
```

### Build the pieces
```bash
make -C sim/axsim axsim         # the golden ISS binary
make -C sw/baremetal images     # bare-metal .elf/.bin/.hex (hello, timer, role, tpu, gpu, ...)
make -C sw/kernel   images      # aXos image (build/axos_boot.{elf,bin,hex})
```

aXos build knobs (append to the `sw/kernel` command):

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HOSTLINK=1` | host-managed personality: the console pipe carries the host-link protocol instead of the interactive shell |
| `STORAGE=1` | mount the AXFS SD image path |
| `KERNEL_CONFIG=configs/kernel-cooperative.json` | select an alternate kernel-service profile |

### Run one image on a selected SoC profile
```bash
make sim CONFIG=configs/sim-bram.json \
  RAM_INIT_FILE="$PWD/sw/baremetal/build/hello.hex"

make software CONFIG=configs/sim-axos.json   # build + run the profile's software component
```

---

## 3. Test

Run the narrowest check that covers a change, then the composition suite before
declaring a component or profile ready.

### 3.1 Core / fast
```bash
make -C sim/axsim  test        # ISS against the rv32 ISA suite
make -C sim/unit   test        # directed RTL unit benches (see `run-*` targets for one bench)
make -C sim/cosim  test        # Verilator lock-step cosimulation vs the ISS
```

### 3.2 Bare-metal, three platforms (ISS · QEMU · RTL)
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal check-hello check-timer check-preempt check-fencei
make -C sw/baremetal check-spi check-sd            # RTL-only (SPI-SD path)
```

### 3.3 Accelerator roles (RTL-only — the ISS does not model the role window)
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal check-role     # role.loopback contract proof
make -C sw/baremetal check-tpu      # TPU-lite folded int8 GEMM vs on-core reference
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu      # GPU-compute SIMT engine vs on-core reference (8-lane)
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu-perf # GPU throughput regression vs on-core (8-lane)
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu1     # gpu1 banked SIMT engine vs on-core ISA oracle
```
Two role components, each tuned by parameter rather than duplicated per size:

- `role.gpu1` — the current engine: banked global memory and a control ISA
  (divergence, branches, divide, shuffle).  Parameters: `lanes`, `banks`,
  `enable_div`, `enable_shfl`.
- `role.gpu-compute` — the earlier single-port engine, kept as the reference the
  gpu1 store-ordering semantics are matched against.  Parameter: `lanes`.

Software reads the geometry from the role's CAPS register, so `check-gpu1` is
the check for any parameterisation.  See
[hardware-capabilities.md](hardware-capabilities.md) for measured cycles.

### 3.4 Components / composition
```bash
make config-check-all              # all profiles resolve
make component-test                # runs the supplied composition matrix (slower)
make -C sw/baremetal check-suite-minimal   # lean-component family in one suite
make -C sim/unit run-suite-ax2            # every core.ax2 tier vs the official ISA suite
make -C sim/unit run-suite-gpu1           # every role.gpu1 tier vs the ISA oracle
make -C sw/baremetal check-suite-ax2      # ax2 + gpu1 SoC integration
```
Prefer **suites** over a check-plus-profile per hardware combination: a suite
exercises a family of components together.  `check-suite-minimal` runs
`core.minimal` driving the CPU (hello), the GPU role, and the TPU role from the
`sim-minimal*` fixtures.  Add a suite when a family of components (a new core,
an accelerator variant) warrants coverage without one-off profiles.

The ax2 and gpu1 suites show the shape to copy for a **parameterised** family.
Tier coverage lives in `sim/unit`, which builds each tier's RTL directly and so
needs no profile per tier; only the SoC-integration leg needs a profile, and it
needs one (`sim-ax2.json`, `sim-ax2-gpu1.json`), not one per tier.  A tier sweep
does not belong in `configs/` — the tiers differ only in parameters, and adding
a profile each would duplicate coverage the unit suite already has.

### 3.4a Tuning a component
```bash
python3 tools/configure.py describe core.ax2     # what it exposes and the defaults
```
A component is the unit of *architecture*; a size inside it is a build-time
parameter.  A new component is warranted when the architecture changes — a
different pipeline, a different privilege model, a different execution model —
not when a cache or a lane count changes.  So `core.ax2` is one component with
`issue_width`, `icache_kb`, and `btb_entries`, and `role.gpu1` is one component
with `lanes`, `banks`, `enable_div`, and `enable_shfl`.

A profile overrides by name, under the component's kind:

```json
{
  "components": { "core": "core.ax2", "role": "role.gpu1" },
  "parameters": {
    "core": { "issue_width": 1, "icache_kb": 8 },
    "role": { "lanes": 16, "banks": 16 }
  }
}
```

The manifest declares each parameter with the default that *defines the
baseline*, so an unparameterised profile is the reference configuration.
Overrides are validated: naming a parameter the component does not declare is a
configuration error that lists what it does declare, the same discipline that
makes component selection validated rather than hopeful.  Parameters reach the
RTL as `+define+` flags, because they must cross stock module boundaries
(`axcore`, `axrole`) whose port and parameter lists are shared with every other
implementation and must not grow implementation-specific knobs.

### 3.4b Benchmarking
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal images
python3 tools/bench.py cpu     # IPC per core and per ax2 parameter setting
python3 tools/bench.py gpu     # kernel cycles per role parameter setting
python3 tools/bench.py tpu     # int8 GEMM accelerator versus the host CPU
python3 tools/bench.py render  # render workload vs cache policy/size and divider
python3 tools/bench.py         # all four
```
The sweep needs a profile per configuration, but those are measurement fixtures
rather than supported ones, so `bench.py` generates them into a scratch
directory instead of the catalog.  What it sweeps is mostly *parameters* now,
which is the point: the numbers show what each knob is worth instead of
asserting that several near-identical components differ.

### 3.5 Kernel (aXos) — needs `qemu-system-riscv32` ≥ 7

`check-boot` covers three things on the ISS, QEMU, and the RTL: the interactive
shell, the fork/wait demo, and `exec` — which loads `sw/kernel/userprog/hello.c`
as an ELF the kernel has never linked against.  The userspace ABI it targets is
[abi.md](abi.md); the syscall table (`syscall.linux-compat`) and the image
format (`loader.elf32`) are both selectable components, as is the C library
(`libc.axlibc`) that user programs link against.

Write a user program in `sw/kernel/userprog/` as ordinary C: it gets a `main()`,
malloc, printf, string functions, 64-bit arithmetic, and `open`/`read`/`lseek`/
`fstat` on files, and is built and linked entirely separately from the kernel,
reaching it only as an embedded image.  Files come from the selected
`filesystem` component — the SD card when one is present, and a built-in
read-only root when there is not, so a program can read a file on every profile
rather than only the ones with storage.
```bash
make -C sw/kernel check-boot QEMU=/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32   # shell + fork/wait on ISS, QEMU, RTL
make -C sw/kernel kernel-component-test QEMU=/path/to/...        # default + cooperative scheduler
make -C sw/kernel check-memory          # 32 MiB cached external-memory RTL
make -C sw/kernel check-storage         # AXFS mount over SPI-SD (RTL)
make -C sw/kernel check-storage-write   # AXFS write/readback (RTL)
make -C sw/kernel check-sdboot          # boot ROM + SD boot through physical-SDRAM RTL
```

### 3.6 Shell control plane + host-link (RTL-only)
```bash
make -C sw/kernel check-role-driver     # aXos drives role.loopback from its own shell
make -C sw/kernel check-hostlink        # axhost drives loopback, TPU-lite, and GPU-compute over the link
```

### 3.7 Randomized + formal (run on core / RVFI / translation changes)
```bash
make -C sim/testgen fuzz           # long randomized instruction lock-step
make -C sim/testgen paging         # randomized Sv32 paging
make -C formal check               # riscv-formal bounded proofs (needs the formal tier)
```

### 3.8 Recommended full regression
```bash
make config-check-all
make -C sim/axsim test
make -C sim/cosim test
make -C sw/baremetal images
make -C sw/baremetal check-hello check-timer check-preempt check-fencei check-role check-tpu check-gpu
make component-test
make -C sw/kernel kernel-component-test QEMU=/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32
make -C sw/kernel check-role-driver check-hostlink
make -C formal check          # after core/RVFI changes
```

## 4. Deploy (FPGA synthesis → physical board)

Physical deployment is the **final evidence gate**.  Simulation passing is not
board proof.  The board component selects the flow; three boards are supported:

| Board | Profile | Flow | Main memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| ULX3S-85F (Lattice ECP5) | `configs/ulx3s-85f.json` | ECP5 | external SDRAM + fabric ROM |
| Tang Nano 20K (Gowin GW2A-18C) | `configs/tangnano20k.json` | Gowin | 32 KB on-chip block RAM (BSRAM) |
| Tang Primer 25K Dock (Gowin GW5A-25A) | `configs/tangprimer25k.json` | Gowin | 32 KB on-chip block RAM (BSRAM) |

What each board can actually run, per configuration, backed by real synth/sim
runs: [hardware-capabilities.md](hardware-capabilities.md). Board procedures
and safety notes: [tangprimer25k-bringup.md](tangprimer25k-bringup.md)
and [ulx3s-bringup.md](ulx3s-bringup.md).

### 4.1 Tool check
```bash
source "$HOME/opt/oss-cad-suite/environment"
make -C rtl/fpga check-tools  COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # flow-specific tools
make -C rtl/fpga toolchain-report COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json
```

### 4.2 Synthesis-only gate (no P&R tools needed)
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga synth COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json   # yosys netlist only
make -C rtl/fpga synth COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangprimer25k.json # GW5A netlist only
```
`synth` is the "does the design map for this board" check: it runs Yosys alone,
so it passes with only `yosys` installed. For both Tang profiles it must map
the 32 KB RAM to block RAM (`DPB` cells), not flip-flops — the memory uses
registered reads (`axram` `SYNC_READ=1`) precisely so it infers BSRAM.

### 4.3 Synthesis, place-and-route, bitstream
```bash
make fpga CONFIG=configs/ulx3s-85f.json     # top-level wrapper (ECP5), or:
make fpga CONFIG=configs/tangnano20k.json   # Gowin/Tang Nano
make fpga CONFIG=configs/tangprimer25k.json # Gowin/Tang Primer 25K
make -C rtl/fpga config COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # print resolved selection
```
The P&R tool (`nextpnr-ecp5` / `nextpnr-himbaechel`) prints utilisation and
timing at the end; the board clock target (25 MHz ULX3S, 27 MHz Tang Nano,
50 MHz Tang Primer) must pass. Do not program a bitstream from a failed or
unconstrained P&R run.

### 4.4 Program the board
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga program COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # reversible SRAM config
```
`program` targets the board named in the manifest (`ulx3s`, `tangnano20k`, or
`tangprimer25k`).
Then open the console (`picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`) and confirm the UART
transcript; for the Tang Nano the BL616 exposes the USB serial and LED5 shows a
~0.5 s heartbeat.

For Tang Primer use the same command with `configs/tangprimer25k.json`; its
programmer name is `tangprimer25k`, the onboard debugger UART is 115200 8-N-1,
and S1 resets the SoC. The Dock has no ordinary FPGA user LED, so UART is the
verdict.

### 4.5 Persistent flash — only after a passing board proof
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga flash COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # writes config flash
```
`program` is the normal dev path; flash is persistent.

## 5. Maintaining this document

After every milestone, update this file in the same change if the milestone:

- adds or renames a `check-*`, build, or deploy target;
- introduces a new build knob (like `HOSTLINK=1`) or profile that users run;
- changes a required tool or version.

Keep the command groups and the §3.8 full-regression sequence current.  A
milestone is not done until its reproducible command lives here.
