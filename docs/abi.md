# aXos userspace ABI

The contract between a user program and aXos: how a program is loaded, what
state it starts in, and how it asks the kernel for something.

## The decision, and why

**Follow the RISC-V Linux ABI where one exists.  Make every layer of it
replaceable.**

There is no interesting originality available in syscall numbering, and a great
deal of value in not needing any: a standard ABI means an unmodified newlib or
picolibc can be retargeted onto it, an unmodified cross-compiler emits correct
code, and a program written for it is not written for atomiX alone.  Inventing
numbers would cost a libc port and buy nothing.

That is a default, not a constraint.  The syscall table is a selectable
component, the numbers and the dispatch live in one place, and there is a
reserved range for calls that have no Linux equivalent.  Someone who wants a
different ABI writes a different `syscall` component and keeps the loader, the
allocator, and the filesystem.  The point of the standard here is that you
should not *have* to think about it, not that you may not.

## Calling convention

Unchanged from the RISC-V Linux convention, which the existing kernel already
follows:

| register | role |
|---|---|
| `a7` | syscall number |
| `a0`–`a5` | arguments 1–6 |
| `a0` | return value |

A program executes `ecall` from U-mode.  The kernel resumes it at `sepc + 4`.

**Errors are negative return values**, `-errno`, exactly as Linux does it: a
return in `[-4095, -1]` is an error, anything else is a result.  This is what
lets a libc wrapper be the standard three-line "negate into errno, return -1"
shim rather than something atomiX-specific.

Registers other than `a0` are preserved across a syscall.  The kernel saves and
restores the full user register file, so a program need not treat `ecall` as a
clobbering call.

## Syscall numbers

From `asm-generic/unistd.h`, which is the table RISC-V Linux uses.  These
numbers are not ours to choose and are listed here only so the contract is
readable in one place.

| number | call | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 56 | `openat` | RISC-V has no `open`; `AT_FDCWD` is -100 |
| 57 | `close` | |
| 62 | `lseek` | on 32-bit this number is `llseek`; see below |
| 63 | `read` | |
| 64 | `write` | fds 1 and 2 reach the console |
| 80 | `fstat` | asm-generic 32-bit `struct stat`, 80 bytes |
| 93 | `exit` | |
| 172 | `getpid` | |
| 214 | `brk` | the heap `malloc` grows |
| 220 | `clone` | RISC-V has no `fork`; `clone` with SIGCHLD is fork |
| 260 | `wait4` | |

Two of these correct existing deviations.  The current kernel has `SYS_FORK = 1`
and `SYS_WAIT = 4`, which are neither Linux numbers nor Linux semantics; the
RISC-V ABI has no `fork` or `wait` at all, only `clone` and `wait4`.  The
migration keeps the behaviour and changes the number and the signature.

`SYS_CONSOLE_PUTC = 2` disappears entirely: it is `write(1, &c, 1)`.

### Reserved range for atomiX calls

`0x1000` and above is private and will never collide with the asm-generic table.
It is where calls that genuinely have no Linux equivalent go — the first being
the accelerator role driver, which is the whole reason this machine is
interesting and has no business being disguised as an `ioctl`:

| number | call | notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0x1000 | `role_info` | discover the role: id, version, capability word |
| 0x1001 | `role_submit` | run a job on the role window |

These are ours to define and to change.  Anything in the standard range is not.

## Program loading

**ELF32, little-endian, RISC-V**, loaded directly rather than pre-flattened.
The same reasoning: it is what the toolchain already emits, it carries the
segment permissions the loader needs to map pages correctly, and a flat image
would need a bespoke header that every tool would have to learn.

The loader walks `PT_LOAD` program headers, maps each at its virtual address
with its `p_flags` permissions, zeroes the `.bss` gap between `p_filesz` and
`p_memsz`, and enters at `e_entry`.

This pins a pairing: mapping pages needs S/U modes and Sv32, so a profile that
hosts programs selects **`core.pipeline5`**.  `core.ax2` is machine-mode only
and cannot host userspace — it is the bare-metal and accelerator-host core.
That constraint is real and worth stating plainly rather than discovering later.

## Initial process state

At `e_entry` the program sees the standard System V layout, because that is what
a libc's `_start` already expects:

```
sp -> argc
      argv[0..argc-1]
      NULL
      envp[0..n-1]
      NULL
      auxv (AT_PAGESZ, AT_PHDR, AT_PHENT, AT_PHNUM, AT_ENTRY, AT_NULL)
```

`sp` is 16-byte aligned.  All other registers are zero — notably, nothing is
passed in registers, so a program must not read `a0` at entry.

## Errno

The subset the initial calls can return, with Linux values:

| value | name | when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `EPERM` | operation not permitted |
| 2 | `ENOENT` | no such file |
| 5 | `EIO` | the block device failed a read |
| 9 | `EBADF` | bad file descriptor |
| 12 | `ENOMEM` | out of memory |
| 14 | `EFAULT` | bad address from userspace |
| 22 | `EINVAL` | invalid argument |
| 24 | `EMFILE` | descriptor table full |
| 30 | `EROFS` | write access to a read-only volume |
| 36 | `ENAMETOOLONG` | path longer than `path_max` |
| 38 | `ENOSYS` | syscall not implemented |

`ENOSYS` is the honest answer for every number the table does not carry, and a
libc will do the right thing with it.

## What is tweakable

| layer | how |
|---|---|
| syscall table and dispatch | the `syscall` component; write another to define a different ABI |
| descriptor count, path length, I/O chunk, write size | parameters on that component |
| the on-disk format and the diskless root | the `filesystem` component |
| private calls | the `0x1000+` range |
| loader input format | the `loader` component, if a flat image is wanted after all |

The parameters are declared in the component manifest and overridden per profile
by name, like every other tunable in the tree (see
[workflow.md](workflow.md) §3.4a).

## Files

A program opens a name, reads byte ranges from it, seeks within it, and asks
how big it is.  That is the whole of it, and it is enough for a program to
*read a file* -- the one thing the original evidence bar asked for that the
loader and the C library together could not do.

**Descriptors start at 3.**  0, 1 and 2 are the console and are never table
entries; `close` on one succeeds and does nothing, because the console is not a
file and cannot be reopened, and returning `-EBADF` would break the ordinary
libc shutdown path to make a point no program benefits from.

**The volume is read-only through the ABI.**  `openat` with any access mode
other than `O_RDONLY` returns `-EROFS`, even on a writable AXFS card.  This is
not a policy choice about permissions: the filesystem seam replaces a whole
file at a time (`fs_write(name, data)`) and has no "write through a descriptor"
operation, so accepting `O_WRONLY` would hand back a descriptor that must fail
on first use.  `-EROFS` at open is the answer a program can act on.  Writable
descriptors need `fs_write` to become an offset-and-length call first.

**`lseek` is `llseek`.**  Number 62 on 32-bit RISC-V takes the offset as a
register pair and returns the new position through a 64-bit out-parameter, with
0 in `a0` -- five arguments, not three:

```
a0 = fd, a1 = offset_high, a2 = offset_low, a3 = uint64_t *result, a4 = whence
```

This is exactly the sort of detail that following a standard is *for*.  A
32-bit `lseek` returning the offset in `a0` would be simpler and would work
perfectly with the libc in this tree -- and would silently fail with any real
rv32 libc, which emits the call above.  Collapsing it to a 32-bit offset is the
libc wrapper's job, and `libc.axlibc` does exactly that in eight lines.

**`fstat` fills the asm-generic 32-bit `struct stat`**: 80 bytes, `st_size` at
offset 32, `st_mode` at 8, `st_blksize` at 36, `st_blocks` at 44.  Fields this
system does not record -- device, inode, owner, timestamps -- report zero, which
is honest for a filesystem that has never had them.  A regular file reports
`S_IFREG | 0444`; a console descriptor reports `S_IFCHR | 0666`, which is what a
libc checks to decide whether to line-buffer.

**One descriptor table, not one per process.**  A per-process table needs a
field in `struct task` and a duplication rule in `clone`, and this kernel runs
one program at a time.  Sharing across a fork is also closer to correct than
not, since Linux's forked descriptors share their file offsets anyway.  The
kernel calls `syscall_reset()` when it starts a program, so descriptors never
survive a run.  When more than one program is runnable at once this becomes a
per-task table -- and that is the point at which it should, not before.

### Where the files come from when there is no disk

The filesystem component mounts the SD card, and presents a small built-in
read-only root when no card answers.  Every profile that boots from RAM has no
card, so without this the question "can a program read a file" would be
answerable only on the storage platforms.  The fallback lives in the filesystem
component rather than in the shell -- which is where an equivalent table used to
live -- so `ls`, `cat`, and `openat` all go through one lookup and one read path
whether or not there is hardware behind it.  It is read-only because a root with
no device behind it cannot honestly accept a write.

## Deliberate omissions

Not in the first ABI, each for a reason rather than by oversight:

- **Signals.** A large mechanism whose absence a freestanding program does not
  notice.  `wait4` reports exit status without them.
- **`mmap`.** `brk` is enough for `malloc`; `mmap` matters when there is dynamic
  linking or file mapping, and there is neither yet.
- **Threads.** `clone` is present only in its fork-shaped form.  Real thread
  support needs a scheduler contract that does not exist.
- **`ioctl`.** The escape hatch that ABIs go to die in.  Accelerator access is
  an explicit call in the private range instead.

## Status

Everything in the table is implemented except the private range.

| call | state |
|---|---|
| `clone`, `wait4`, `exit`, `getpid` | implemented |
| `write` (fds 1, 2) | implemented, with `-EFAULT` / `-EBADF` |
| `read` (fd 0) | implemented, returns 0 (no input source bound) |
| `brk` | implemented: maps/unmaps heap pages between the image and the stack |
| `openat`, `close`, `read`, `lseek`, `fstat` | implemented, read-only |
| `role_info`, `role_submit` | numbers reserved, `-ENOSYS` |
| ELF loader | implemented (`loader.elf32`) |
| C library | implemented (`libc.axlibc`) |

`sw/kernel/user.S` is the conformance test, deliberately hand-written so the ABI
is checked against *this document* rather than against whatever a libc happens
to emit.  It verifies that an unknown number returns `-ENOSYS` rather than
killing the process, that `getpid` is plausible, that a bad user pointer is
`-EFAULT` rather than a supervisor fault, and that a bad descriptor is `-EBADF`
-- then runs the fork/wait demo through `clone` and `wait4`.  Evidence:
`make -C sw/kernel check-boot`, which runs it on the ISS, on QEMU, and on the
RTL.

The loader is `loader.elf32`, behind a `loader` component seam so the image
format is replaceable without touching the kernel or the ABI.  It parses
ET_EXEC ELF32 RISC-V images, maps each `PT_LOAD` segment at its own virtual
address with its own `p_flags` permissions, zero-fills the `.bss` tail beyond
`p_filesz`, and builds the System V initial stack described above.  Dynamic
linking is out of scope: `PT_INTERP` and relocations are rejected rather than
half-handled, which is the whole of what a statically linked libc needs.

Its evidence is `sw/kernel/userprog/hello.c` — compiled and linked as its own
freestanding ELF, entirely separately from the kernel, reaching it only as an
opaque byte array.  Nothing about it is resolved at kernel link time, so if it
runs, the loader really did parse an ELF and map it.  It checks that `.data`
arrived with its initialiser, that `.bss` is present and zero, that `.data` is
actually writable, and that `.rodata` is readable, exiting with a distinct code
per failure so a break says *which* part of the load went wrong.  Evidence:
`make -C sw/kernel check-boot`, which runs it on the ISS, QEMU, and the RTL.

## The C library

`libc.axlibc` is a small freestanding library — `crt0`, syscall wrappers with
errno, string and memory primitives, a first-fit allocator over `sbrk`, and a
console `printf` subset.  It is a component, so a profile can select a real libc
(picolibc, newlib) instead and nothing above it changes: everything it provides
uses the standard spelling.

It is deliberately incomplete.  No floating point (there is no FPU, and a
soft-float `%f` pulls in a large chunk of libgcc for nothing), no locale, no
signals, and no threads.  There are still no `FILE` streams: files are reached
through `open`/`read`/`lseek`/`close`, which is what the kernel offers, and
`fopen` would mostly be a buffering layer that the 128 KiB budget would rather
spend elsewhere.  A program that wants buffered reads can do them itself, and
`printf` is already line-buffered.

`malloc` is first-fit with forward coalescing only.  Backward coalescing needs
either a footer per block or a doubly-linked list, and that extra word per
allocation costs more on a 128 KiB machine than the fragmentation it avoids.  A
pathological alloc/free pattern will fragment; that is an honest limit of a
basic allocator rather than a defect.

`brk` became real to support it: the kernel now maps zero-filled pages between
the top of the loaded image and a one-page guard below the stack, and unmaps
whole pages on shrink.  The guard means a heap that grows too far fails a
`brk()` rather than silently colliding with the stack — the failure mode that is
impossible to debug after the fact.

Two implementation notes worth recording: `sstatus.SUM` is deliberately left
clear, so S-mode cannot dereference user addresses at all.  Every syscall
pointer is translated through `vm_translate_user`, which walks the task's page
table and checks the `U` and `R`/`W` bits.  That is what makes `-EFAULT` a real
answer instead of a hope -- unprivileged code cannot fault the kernel by passing
a garbage address, and the conformance test proves it by passing one.

Second, an address space now records page *ownership* in the Sv32 PTE's
supervisor-software bit (bit 8).  It has to: the built-in payload's code page is
part of the kernel image and freeing it would hand kernel memory back to the
page allocator, while every page a loader maps came from `page_alloc` and leaks
if it is not freed.  Teardown walks the leaves and frees exactly the owned ones,
and the exit path asserts that every page comes back -- so a loader that leaks a
segment fails the test rather than slowly exhausting memory.
